# Machine-Learning-in-Robotics-course

This repository contains code from final projects of several courses I've taken at NU.

/image processing : MATLAB code and final paper submission of work on image
texture synthesis

/machine dynamics : Mathematica code and video of the final submission of
coin toss simulation that utilized Lagrangian dynamics

/machine learning robotics : contains MATLAB code, plots, and writeup of a
final project in which I improved robot SLAM using NN

/machine learning : contains an assignment for which I built a NN classifier from
scratch which categorized handwritten numbers

/mechatronics : contains code for the final project in which the position of a motorized
propeller was controlled using PID
